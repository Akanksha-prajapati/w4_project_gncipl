Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations

Implementation of clustering algorithms:

K-Means

Hierarchical Clustering

DBSCAN

Evaluation using metrics like Silhouette Score & Davies–Bouldin Index

Visualization of cluster results

🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: Python 3.x

Libraries:

Pandas, NumPy (data manipulation)

Matplotlib, Seaborn (visualization)

Scikit-learn (clustering algorithms & evaluation)
